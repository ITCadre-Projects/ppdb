# ppdb
ppdb is IT Cadre's Past Performance Database.

The goal is to have a central catalog of work to aid in proposal development.  The two major areas will be:

1. A place where delivery teams can upload descriptions and project artifacts.
2. A place where contract/proposal teams can upload their work to reference in the future.

These two areas will be firewalled off - delivery teams will not have access to contracts/proposals.
